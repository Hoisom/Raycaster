# Raycast Engine
#### Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/Br5pFc4GNXQ

## Overview

This project is built using pygame and is a raycaster engine, which is a technique used to display pseudo-3D graphics. It uses rays sent out from a character to interact with the surroundings. Depending on the length of this ray, it will draw a line on screen, following the fact that things that are further away appear smaller. This technique is most widely known to be used by Wolfenstein 3D in 1992. 

## Rays
The player is represented by a coordinate (E.g. (203, 127)) representing their pixel position on screen (which can be manipulated using the W key for forwards and S for backwards). The player also has a rotation (controlled with A and D). This rotation is where the player is facing, but they are also able to see 33 degrees to the left and right of this, for a 66 degree field of view. Within this FOV, hundreds of invisible lines moving outwards are fired, originating from the player. These are called "rays". When this ray interacts with something, such as a wall, the length of that ray is returned and a corresponding line is drawn on screen. This line spans from the top to the bottom of the screen, and lines are drawn from left to right. 

Using this as an example of the map:

```
(player) | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
```

The player would shoot a ray to the right, and check the first "|" if it is a wall (0 represents open space and 1 is a wall). This is repeated over and over until it comes into contact with a wall or goes too far and is registered as having no wall in that direction, or being out of the depth of field. After touching a wall, it stops and does not check further.

### Digital Differential Analyzer

DDA is the algorithm used to check if the ray has hit a wall. Due to the grid like nature of the map, a wall can only occupy 1 full cell, and each cell is evenly spaced. Using this, the rays position is checked every time it intersects with the border of cell, checking whether it is a wall, and if not, simply increments the position to check the next cell. 

## Map

Maps are easily changed and updated in the engine. It utilises a grid system like so: 
```
map = [
    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
]
```

Everything is stored in a 2-dimensional list which can freely change in size, with numbers other than 0 representing a wall with different colours.

* 0 is empty, walkable space
* 1 is a red wall
* 2 is a green wall
* 3 is a blue wall
* 4 is a white wall
* anything else is a yellow wall
